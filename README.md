Hi! I made this script because i wanted to see how will ZTF images look when viewed as stacked RGBs, i will add here more of the story and new features for now i am adding this repo so i won't forget to post it.

A simple script to search for and download ZTF frames from the IPAC archive, convert them to TIFF, and standardize their sizes for stacking.

## Installation
